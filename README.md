## Problem We're Solving
- 65% of people give up on their workout plans within 3 to 6 months, in part due to a lack of sustained enjoyment during physical exercise and the delayed gratification
- It can be difficult to identify the right balance between challenge and enjoyment, especially for less experienced runners and runners with special conditions (disabilities, injuries etc.)

*Extra Mile* leverages Arctop's neural interface technology and AR immersion to make running more fun and effective across 3 levers:
- **Pacer:** the pacer (overlayed in AR) leverages the user's real-time movement and biometric information (heart rate, enjoyment index, flow state index) to provide just the right pace at any point in the run - maximizing the time the user spends in 'flow state'
- **Gamification:** Real-time feedback (e.g. pacer avatar changes color during flow moments) provides instant gratification while exerciszing, and the mobile app helps the user set concrete goals.
- **Self-coaching:** the mobile app lets the user track their progress and explore the relationship between athletic performance, enjoyment and physical health.

## Target user
*Caveat: the current size and weight of AR equipment isn't ideal for use during intense physical activity. This project serves as a proof of concept for technological opportunity space for nascent technologies.*

## Mobile App
The mobile application let's users review their progress and uncover the relationship between their running stats (distance run, pace, consistency) and biometric information (heart rate, enjoyment, flow state)
